## Functionality

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

The tool is designed specifically for poll results in Switzerland which are done prior to votings on intiatives and referendums. Hence, we have two pre-defined scales:

- Three answer scale

![Poll result with three answer scale](./readme-images/three-answer-poll.png)

- Five answer scale

![Poll result with five answer scale](./readme-images/five-answer-poll.png)

The scales can also be mixed together:

![Poll result with mixed answer scales](./readme-images/mixed-scale-poll.png)

### Implementation

### Options

There are no options for this tool.
