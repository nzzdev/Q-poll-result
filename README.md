# Q poll result

Q poll result is one tool of the Q toolbox to render poll results.

## Example

The tool is designed specifically for poll results in Switzerland which are done prior to votings on intiatives and referendums. Hence, we have two pre-defined scales:

* Three answer scale

* Five answer scale

The scales can also be mixed together:

## Implementation details

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).
